{"name":"Glint2","tagline":"Regridding Library for GCM / Ice Model Coupling","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nGLINT2 is a library intended for the coupling of climate models (GCMs) and ice models.  It was developed by [Robert Fischer](http://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/rfischer/) (@citibob) at NASA GISS in New York City, and is licensed via the GPL v3.  GLINT2 is written in C++, and is intended for use with GCMs and climate models written in C/C++ and Fortran 2003.\r\n\r\nGLINT2 implements the transformations described in the paper _A System of Conservative Regridding for Ice / Atmosphere Coupling in a GCM_ (not yet published).\r\n\r\nGLINT2 code may be downloaded at this GitHub repository.  GLINT2 documentation is found at [this project's Wiki](https://github.com/citibob/glint2/wiki).\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in using GLINT2 or joining as a committer, please email Robert Fischer <robert.fischer@nasa.gov>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
