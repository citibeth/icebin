/** Produces a smoothing matrix that "smears" one grid cell into

    The vector space (gridX) in question has two forms of indexing:
        * Sparse (_s): Native indexing, no guarantee that indices are closely spaced.
          Some grid cells could be unused.
        * Dense (_d): A dense renumbering of grid cells, resulting in ONLY the ones needed
          for this (and other current) operations.
    @param ret_d
        Receptacle for the smoothing matrix.
        Uses dense indexing.
    @param gridX
        Grid being used (sparse indexing)
    @param dimX
        Translation between dense (local to our computing) and sparse
        (grid-native) indexing.
    @param elev_s
        Elevation of each grid cell.
        NaN for grid cells that are masked out.
        Indexed by sparse (grid-native) indexing
    @param area_d
        (Generalized) area of each grid cell.  This
        will typically be a weight vector for a regridding matrix; for
        example, for IvA or IvE.  There is area only for grid cells
        that overlap the A/E grid.
        Indexed by dense indexing
    @param sigma
        Scale size of the Gaussian smoothing function.  If smoothing
        the IvA matrix, than sigma[0] and sigma[1] should be about the
        size of an A grid cell and sigma[2] infinity.  If smoothing IvE,
        then sigma[2] should be about the elevation difference between
        different elevation classes.
