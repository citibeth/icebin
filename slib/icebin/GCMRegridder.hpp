/** 

This module produces regridding matrices between the following vector
spaces (grids):

     Description                    Geometry
---------------------------------------------
A  = Atmosphere grid                sphere
Ap = Projected atmosphere grid      plane
E  = Elevation grid                 sphere
Ep = Projected elevation grid       plane
I  = Ice grid                       plane

The atmosphere grid ``A`` is assumed to be L0 (aribtrary polygonal
grid cells with constant value inside).  However, ``I`` may use any
set of basis functions; for example, a finite element mesh.  The
following "grids" are also used sometimes:

G = Interpolation Grid
    --> For constant-value (L0) ice grids, this is either the ice grid itself,
    or the exchange grid (overlap) between ``I`` and ``A``.


Regridding Basics
-----------------

* The symbol ``nX = |X|`` is the number of basis functions (grid cells) in
  a given vector space.  Not all of these need to be *realized*: an
  ice grid, for example, might have some cells that are masked out
  because they don't contain ice.

* A regridding matrix named ``BvA`` (size ``nb`` * ``nA``) regrides
  vectors from grid ``A`` to ``B``.

* ``wA`` is the vector (or diagonal matrix) containing the weight
  (area) of each basis function (grid cell) of ``A``.

* ``sA`` is the inverse of ``wA``... it is a "scaling" matrix, not a
  "weight" matrix.

* All regridding from ``A`` to ``B`` is accomplished by taking the
  inner product of the ``B`` basis functions with the `f(x,y)` defined
  by ``A``.  This is accomplished by computing the unscaled matrix
  ``BvA``, where the ``(j,i)`` element is the inner product of the
  ``j``th basis function of ``B`` with the ``i``th basis function of
  ``A``.  This has some interesting properties:

  #. The unscaled ``AvB`` and unscaled ``BvA`` are transposes of each
     other.  Computing the unscaled ``AvB`` there fore the first step
     to computing the final scaled ``AvB`` or ``BvA``.

  #. This matrix produces *unscaled* results; that is, if the vector
    ``a`` is in [kg m-2], then the product ``BvA * a`` will be in
    [kg].  One must divide by ``wB`` to get a scaled result.

  #. The scaling weights for an unscaled ``BvA`` may be obtained by
     summing over the rows or columns.  This is almost always
     preferable to using overall weights ``wA`` and ``wB`` of the grid
     cells because it properly accounts for cells of ``A`` and ``B``
     that do not overlap the other grid.  We call these (diagonal)
     weight matrices ``wAvB`` and ``wBvA``.  Their inverses are
     ``sAvB`` and ``sBvA``.

* Putting it together... if one has an unscaled ``BvA`` and have
  summed its rows to obtain ``wBvA``, then the scaled regridding
  matrix will be ``sBvA * BvA``.

* The atmosphere and elevation grids ``A`` and ``E`` exist on a
  sphere, not a plane.  They therefore cannot interact with the ice
  grid, which exists on a plane.  This issue is resolved by
  *projecting* ``A`` and ``E`` onto the plane.  The result is the
  grids ``Ap`` and ``Ep``, which we *can* regrid to/from ``I``.  A
  diagonal scaling matrix ``sApvA`` converts from ``A`` to ``Ap`` (or
  ``E`` to ``Ep``).  There is symmetry here: note that ``sApvA`` =
  ``wAvAp``

Regrid Hierarchy
----------------

Regridding matrices are computed in a three-level hierarhcy:

* ``IceRegridder``: Computes a variety of basic unscaled regrid
  component matrices: ``sApvA``, ``GvAp``, ``sEpvE``, ``GvEp``,
  ``GvI``.  These are computed based on detailed knowledge of the
  grids; they will vary depending on the grid's parameterization,
  outlines, etc.  Note the symmetry between ``A`` and ``E`` here:
  although the details of how matrices regridding to ``A`` and ``E``
  may vary, they are *used* in algebraically similar ways.

* Ur ("original") Matrices: The ``UrAE`` class encapsulates the algebraic symmetry
  between ``A`` and ``E``.  Depending on how it's instantiated, it
  will provide *either* ``GvAp`` and ``sApvA`` *or* ``GvEp`` and
  ``sEpvE`` (taken from the lower-level functions in the step above).

  The Ur instance is passed into higher-level functions that will
  produce regridding matrices going to/from either ``A`` or ``E``.
  For simplicity sake, the grid is always called ``A`` in those
  higher-level routines.

* Matrix Combiner Functions: Three free functions are responsibile for
  multiplying togehter lower-level matrices to compute final regrid *
  matrices.  The final matrices may be either scaled or unscaled; and
  have project issues (``Ap`` vs ``A``) corrected or not corrected.
  Due to the symmetry between ``A`` and ``E``, each one does double
  duty:

      Function               Final Matrices Computed
      ------------------------------------------------
      compute_AEvI()         AvI, EvI
      compute_IvAE()         IvA, IvE
      compute_EvA()          EvA, AvE

* ``RegridMatrices``: The ``RegridMatrices`` class wraps all this
  structure in a simple, top-level interface to generate regridding
  matrices, ``RegridMatrix::regrid()``.  For example:

  .. code-block:: c++

     GCMRegridder gcm_regridder(...);
     RegridMatrices rm(gcm_regridder.sheet("greenland"));
     // rm.regrid("AvI", scale=true, correctA=true)
     auto AvI(rm.regrid("AvI", true, true));
     AvI.M        // The matrix
     AvI.weight   // The weight vector


Sparse Computations
-------------------

Matrices and vectors are represented in coordinate fashion by
``spsparse::SparseMatrix`` and ``spsparse::SparseVector``.  This
representation is good for two reasons:

  1. It is a convenient and flexible way to manage sparse matrices.

  2. It allows matrices to be sparse in their index set, as well as in
     rows and columns: the size of each dimension of the matrix may be
     arbitrarily large, as long as the number of non-zero elements
     fits in memory.  This is useful for implementing aribtrary grids,
     where grid cell indices may become large.

When multiplying these sparse indices and vectors, they are first
converted into Eigen sparse matrices --- which require a dense index
set so that a row or column may be represented as a dense array.
Native indices are mapped to a dense set for Eigen computations, and
then mapped back when the answer is converted back to a ``spsparse``
structure.
